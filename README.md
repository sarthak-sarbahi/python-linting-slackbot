### How to use
- Setup Slack
    - Login to slack and create workspace
    - Create slack app, give name and specify workspace
    - Add scope(s) to bot
    - Install app to workspace (need a channel for the same)
    - Add app to channel
- Handling messages (events)
    - In Slack API go to Event subscriptions
    - Enable events
    - Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
    - Get signing secret from Slack API (basic information)
    - To run ngrok: `ngrok http 5000`` (this will generate a public URL accessible via the internet and it points to flask server running on port 5000)
    - On Slack API page, we need to enter the request url which is `ngrok URL` + `/slack/events``
    - In subscribe to bot events, add the type of event (message.channels) that the slack app should react to. For example, if a message is sent to a channel where slackbot is present, it will be re-directed to the flask app (thanks to ngrok) so that the underlying logic can work with it.
    - Check for additional scopes that might be required to be added and then re-install the app in workspace.
- Start slackbot
    - Start flask server (port 5000)
    - Run ngrok: `ngrok http 5000``
    - Update public URL on slack API page
    - Re-install slack bot app in workspace (if required)
