Steps to setup slackbot:
> Login to slack and create workspace
> Create slack app from scratch, give name and specify workspace
> Add scope to bot
> Install app to workspace (need a channel for the same)
> Add app to channel from slack UI

Handling events
> In Slack API go to Event subscriptions
> Enable events
> Install ngrok
> Get signing secret from Slack API (basic information)
> To run ngrok: ngrok http 5000 (this will generate a public URL accessible via the internet and it points to flask server running on port 5000)
> On Slack API page, we need to enter the request url which is ngrok URL + /slack/events (example: https://d31b-2406-b400-b4-d48c-f16b-3672-f817-2e.ngrok.io/slack/events)
> In subscribe to bot events, add the type of event (message.channels) that the slack app should react to. For example, if a message is sent to a channel where slackbot is present, it will be re-directed to the flask app (thanks to ngrok) so that the underlying logic can work with it.
> Check for additional scopes that might be required to be added and then re-install the app in workspace.

Slash commands
> Go to slash commands on slack API page
> Enter details like command, request URL, description, etc.
> Request URL requires an endpoint (example - https://d31b-2406-b400-b4-d48c-f16b-3672-f817-2e.ngrok.io/message-count)
> Re-install app

Handling reactions
> Need to subscribe to bot event: reaction_added


Running slackbot
> Start flask server
> Run ngrok (ngrok http 5000)
> Update public URL on slack API page
> Re-install slack bot app in workspace (if required)
